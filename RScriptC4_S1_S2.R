#This chapter is about the Rubin Causal Model
#Essentially, when you remove something from a list, we need to find the effect
library(gt)
#Take this data set
tibble(ID = c("Robert", "Andy", "Beau", "Ishan", "Nicolas"),
       Heights = c("178", "?", "172", "173", 165)) %>%
  gt() #Just a way to make tables out of tibbles
#If I told you to get the average height of all 5 people, you'd need to estimate Andy's height
#There are a variety of ways to do this, but the easiest is just taking the average of the other heights
#Thing is, that's not really realistic and leaves a lot to be desired
#Take something more complicated
tibble(ID = c("Student 1", "Student 2", "...", "Student 473", "Student 474",
              "...", "Student 3,258", "Student 3,259", "...", "Student 6,700"),
       Heights = c("?", "?", "...", "172", "?", "...", "?", "162", "...", "?")) %>%
  gt()
#There's a bunch of problems here, so the methods that we might try are going to be completely wrong

tibble(ID = c("Student 1", "Student 2", "...", "Student 473", "Student 474", 
              "...", "Student 3,258", "Student 3,259", "...", "Student 6,700"),

       Sex = c("?", "?", "...", "M", "?", "...", "?", "F", "...", "?"),

#However, once we start adding other variables, like covariates, we might be able to predict a little bit better
#A 7 year old girl definitely has a lower height than a 27 year old man.
#So the Rubin Causal Model measures the amount of change that happens when we change these covariates
#If I change the gender to a girl, there is a 4cm change in height
#That kind of stuff, but actually standardized and in math format

#So take a hypothetical Yao who had a +4 attitude change when he was treated
tibble(ID = "Yao", ytreat = "13", ycontrol = "9") %>% gt()

#This is a nicer graph that shows the estimand
#The estimand is the variable that you're trying to calculate
tibble(subject = "Yao",
       ytreat = "13",
       ycontrol = "9",

  tab_spanner(label = "Estimand", ydiff)

#This is another table but with more people

#From this, there are a lot of variables that you care about
#For example the median estimand, the median percentage change, the average treatment effect, etc

       ytreat = c("13", "11", "?", "?", "6"),

#But for something weird like this, it gets a lot more complex
#So causal is going forward and counterfactual is going backwards
#The main problem is that you have to infer counterfactuals
#If I have data on how dogs are better than cats because they bark.
#This is a causal. Dogs bark so they are better.
#Now, I have to assume that if cats barked they'd be better than dogs
#So little kitty can now bark its displeasure at you. 
#Not exactly the funnest thing. That's what a counterfactual is.
#You have to assume that the counterfactual exists.
#But we can still mess up and choose the wrong counterfactual.

#So let's create a mini experiment. I asked 10000 people what personality they like their pets to have
#We do this by bringing in a few cats and a few dogs and having the people play around with them
#They then answer a survey about whether they like the personality and how the pet acted
#Someone might like a cat that sits in your lap and someone might like a smart dog
#So just that kind of thing.
#We're trying to see if there's a causal relationship between personality and somebody liking the pet
#Now, we have a few variables to talk about
#Unit (Indexed by i): The person's review
#Treatment variable T_i: Whether the pet's personality was cold and distant or warm and fuzzy (only 2 possibilities)
#Treatment group: The pets with a cold personality
#Control group: The pets with a warm personality
#Outcome variable Y_i: Whether they liked the pet or not

#So what does "T_i causes Y_i" mean?
#Would a person like a warm personality or a cold personality more?
